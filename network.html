             <h2>What is Computer Network</h2>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h2>How does a Computer Network work?</h2>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>Nodes and links are the basic building blocks in computer networking. A network node may be data communication equipment (DCE) such as a modem, hub or, switch, or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as two or more computers and printers. A link refers to the transmission media connecting two nodes. Links may be physical, like cable wires or optical fibers, or free space used by wireless networks.</p>

             <h2>Types of computer network architecture?</h2>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>Computer network architecture defines the physical and logical framework of a computer network. It outlines how computers are organized in the network and what tasks are assigned to those computers.They falls under two broad categories</p>
             <br>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Client-server architecture</li>
                    <li>Peer-to-peer architecture</li>

            <h2>What is network topology?</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The arrangement of nodes and links is called network topology. They can be configured in different ways to get different outcomes. Some types of network topologies are</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bus topology</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each node is linked to one other node only. Data transmission over the network connections occurs in one direction.</p>
                    <br>
                <li>Ring topology</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each node is linked to two other nodes, forming a ring. Data can flow bi-directionally. However,single node failure can bring down the entire network.</p>
                    <br>
                <li>Star topology</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>A central server node is linked to multiple client network devices. This topology performs better as data doesnot have to go through each node. It is also more reliable.</p>
                    <br>
                <li>Mesh topology</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every node is connected to many other nodes. In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network.</p>
            </ul>

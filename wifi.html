    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>Wi-Fi is a wireless technology used to connect computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices to the internet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Wi-Fi is the radio signal sent from a wireless router to a nearby device, which translates the signal into data you can see and use. The device transmits a radio signal back to the router, which connects to the internet by wire or cable.</p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a Wi-Fi network?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The term was created by a marketing firm because the wireless industry was looking for a user-friendly name to refer to some not so user-friendly technology known as IEEE 802.11 and the name stuck. Wi-Fi, often referred to as WiFi, wifi, wi-fi or wi fi, is often thought to be short for Wireless Fidelity and the organization that paid for the marketing firm is sometimes referred to as the Wireless Fidelity Alliance Inc. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>How does Wi-Fi work?</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Wi-Fi uses radio waves to transmit data from your wireless router to your Wi-Fi enabled devices like your TV, smartphone, tablet and computer. Because they communicate with each other over airwaves, your devices and personal information can become vulnerable to hackers, cyber-attacks and other threats. This is especially true when you connect to a public Wi-Fi network at places like a coffee shop or airport. When possible, it is best to connect to a wireless network that is password-protected or a personal hotspot</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Types of Wi-Fi connections</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Wireline/router</li>
        <br>
        <p>Most homes use a wireless router to access the internet these days. The pros include convenience of setup, mobility within range of the Wi-Fi access point (router) and the ability to connect multiple devices. The cons: limited bandwidth and reduced speed as more devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, as well as potential interference from other electromagnetic devices in the home.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Mobile hotspot or jetpack</li>
        <br>
        <p>Mobile and dedicated hotspots are becoming a more popular way of connecting safely on the go. Two common hotspot devices are your smartphone and a jetpack. Most any smartphone or tablet today can be used as a temporary hotspot and is a great option if you occasionally need it. It is easy to use and does not require buying extra devices, but it can zap your battery life and data pretty fast. On the other hand, a jetpack acts as a dedicated mobile hotspot that picks up a signal from cell towers in your area just like your smartphone. More devices can connect to it and it offers a greater range of Wi-Fi. And because itâ€™s a separate device, your smartphone battery power does not get touched. The downfall is having to buy the jetpack and a separate plan.</p>
        <br>
        <li>LTE Home Internet</li>
        <br>
        <p>If you live in a rural area where your internet options are limited, 4G LTE Home Internet is worth considering. It offers high speed internet service delivered over cell phone towers and mobile networks with average download speeds around 25 Mbps. The advantages of LTE over satellite are better speeds and reliability depending on your carrier. </p>
        <br>
        <li>5G Home Internet</li>
        <br>
        <p>5G Home Internet (Fixed Wireless Access) is now in more places around the country.Even with multiple devices connected, it is reliable and fast enough to power your whole home. Fixed wireless access has a simple plug and play setup, which means there are no messy wires and no need to wait for a technician to come to your home for setup.</p>
